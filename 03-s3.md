# [ Simple Storage Service \(S3\) ](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/)

This is 3rd entry of my advent calendar in 2017.

## Motivation

I'd like to redirect `http://takkyuuplayer.com` to `https://www.takkyuuplayer.com`.
How about hosting a static website on S3 for the redirection?
I'm using Route 53 so it must be possible.

## Let's use it

First, create a new backet `takkyuuplayer.com` in **US East (N. Virginia)** region. I tried Tokyo region first but I couldn't set alias on Route 53 because console doesn't load S3 website as its target.
Configure the backet as Static website hosting with the `Redirect requests` option, then all requests to
 http://takkyuuplayer.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com were redirected to https://www.takkyuuplayer.com

Let's configure Route 53 so that `takkyuuplayer.com` can be an alias of `takkyuuplayer.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`. Below document was helpful.

Done. http://takkyuuplayer.com

## Consideration

## Conclusion

LGTM to use S3 for static website.
